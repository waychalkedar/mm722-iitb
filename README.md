# Introduction
This repository contains code mde to solve assignments as part of the MM 722: Molecular Simulations for Materials Engineering course at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
As of 06/04/24, this repository is being updated and is unfinished, since the semester is still ongoing.

# Structure
There are separate folders for the respective assignment (e.g. A2 is Assignment 2). These contain:
1. Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that the notebook uses for various aspects of the assignments.
2. The problem statement linked either as a PDF or within the notebook.
3. My submission (either individual for the assignments, or as a team for the midterm and project submission) as a PDF file. The reader is encouraged to go through these PDFs to understand the logic
of what is being done
4. The input script for the simulation or files provided by the instructor, wherever applicable

**NOTE:** The programs inside the Jupyter notebooks assume that the required files (`.dump` trajectory files, thermo files for thermodynamic parameters, or other such files) are in the same directory as the 
notebook. I have not uploaded each file to limit the size of the repository, however, <ins>I highly recommend running the simulation through LAMMPS </ins> to generate the files yourself to test if the code actually
works. LAMMPS can be installed by following the documentation (https://docs.lammps.org/Install.html). 
Or, you can reach out to me for files of specific assignments.
